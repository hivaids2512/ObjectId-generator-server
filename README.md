# My Resume with Node REST API

This project is an example of using NodeJs + Express to make a simple Object generator app.

## Configuration

No need to config :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode on port **8080** . You can custom the port number by setting **PORT** environment variable.

### `npm test`

Runs the Unit test for the app. We use [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chaijs](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) for the tests.
